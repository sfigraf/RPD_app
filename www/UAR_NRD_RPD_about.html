<h3> About the visualization</h3>

<p> Created to better visualize the individual pools within a reach with UAR_NRD data. 
This way you can better see pool depths, crests and how they changed over time. 
</p>

<h4> Whole Reach Plot</h4>
<p>
Shows the entire longitudinal profile survey of a selected reach over the years. Selected pools will highlight a region of the plot based on pool and year. 
Each longitudinal profile survey started from a different place and took a different path,
so each time a year is selected, the x and y limits may change for that specific pool. The station correctors will change the box limits used to highlight the pool.
You can zoom in, pan, export, with the tools in the top right of the plot. Double clicking a year in the legend will isolate that year. 
</p>

<h4> Single Pool Plot </h4>
<p>
Takes station data and normalizes it so that each year "starts" at the same place for the selected pool. This is helpful in seeing an overlay of a single pool and how it fills in or scours over time. 
However, this can't be used to infer pool movement upstream or downstream. 
</p>

<h4> Map </h4>
<p>
Shows each longitudinal profile survey for a given year, along with stations.
